This is Scrapyard Scramble, a card drafting game where players alternate
picking cards from "scrap piles" in order to built a robot. The robot with
the highest score at the end of the game wins. Players can give their robots
more speed and intelligence and the robot with the most of each gains points
at the end of the game. You can play both with a friend and against the 
computer.

To run the game, you just need to run the tp.py file.

Tkinter and Python must be installed.

'r' can be pressed to reset the game at any point.
